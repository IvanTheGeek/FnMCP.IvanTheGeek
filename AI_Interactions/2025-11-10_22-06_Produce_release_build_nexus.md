## Junie Responses

- Built a Release publish for linux-x64 with the executable name set to `nexus`.
- Verified the output directory and resolved the absolute path to the binary.
- Created AI_Interactions logs and committed them to the repository per guidelines.

Result:
- Executable full path: /home/linux/RiderProjects/FnMCP.IvanTheGeek/bin/publish/nexus
- How to run: `chmod +x /home/linux/RiderProjects/FnMCP.IvanTheGeek/bin/publish/nexus && /home/linux/RiderProjects/FnMCP.IvanTheGeek/bin/publish/nexus`
