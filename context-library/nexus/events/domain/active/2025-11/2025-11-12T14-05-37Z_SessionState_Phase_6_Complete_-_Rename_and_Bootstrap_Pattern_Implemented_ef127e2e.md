## Phase 6 Completion Summary

**Objective:** Rename MCP server to FnMCP.Nexus and implement minimal bootstrap file pattern.

**Bootstrap Files Implemented:**
- ✓ nexus-bootstrap.md created and uploaded to Nexus Project Knowledge
- ✓ perdiem-bootstrap.md created and uploaded to PerDiemLog Project Knowledge
- Both include critical token calculation formula with verification examples

**MCP Server Rename:**
- ✓ Solution renamed: FnMCP.IvanTheGeek → FnMCP.Nexus
- ✓ Project renamed with namespace updates
- ✓ MCP configuration updated in claude_desktop_config.json
- ✓ Binary rebuilt and republished
- ✓ Claude Desktop reconnected successfully
- ✓ All MCP tools verified working
- ✓ Changes committed to git

**Token Efficiency Achieved:**
- Nexus Project Knowledge: ~6,000 tokens → ~500 tokens (92% reduction)
- PerDiem Project Knowledge: ~500 tokens (minimal from start)
- Pattern validated and ready for future projects

**Project Instructions Updated:**
- Nexus: Added "No time estimates" line for consistency
- PerDiem: Structured to match Nexus pattern, includes key preferences

## Current State

**Phase 6:** Complete ✓

**Next Phase:** Phase 7 - SessionState projections (if needed)

## Outstanding Items

- LaundryLog graduation to own project (when ready)
