# Context

During master planning session, included time estimates like:
- "Phase 1: 1-2 hours"
- "Total: 13-20 hours work"
- "Each phase 1-6 hours"

User clarified this isn't helpful or wanted.

# The Insight

**User works as opportunity allows** - primary profession is truck driver, development happens in available moments.

Time estimates create pressure and false expectations:
- Implies commitment to timeline
- Doesn't match reality of opportunity-based work
- Phases and structure matter, not duration
- Work happens when it happens

# What Matters in Planning

**✅ Include:**
- Clear phases
- Progression of steps
- Dependencies (Phase 2 after Phase 1)
- Success criteria
- Checklists
- Scope of work

**❌ Exclude:**
- Hour estimates
- Day estimates
- Week estimates
- Timeline commitments
- Duration expectations

# Why This Matters

**Planning should enable, not constrain:**
- Phases show what to do next
- Checklists show progress
- Structure guides work flow
- No artificial time pressure
- Work happens when user has opportunity

**Respect user's context:**
- Professional truck driver
- Development is passion project
- Time is when available
- Quality over speed
- Sustainable pace

# Implementation

**For all future planning:**
- Describe phases and steps
- Show dependencies and sequence
- Provide checklists
- Never include time estimates
- Focus on "what" and "how", not "when"

**Memory updated:**
> "Do not include time estimates for research and planning requests. User works as opportunity allows. Focus on phases and progression."

# Broader Application

This principle applies to all work planning:
- Feature roadmaps (no dates)
- Architecture evolution (phases, not sprints)
- Learning paths (topics, not weeks)
- Documentation plans (scope, not hours)

**The measure is completion, not duration.**
