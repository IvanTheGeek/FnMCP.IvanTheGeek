# Session Summary

Productive session focused on refining preferences, documentation, and establishing patterns for multi-project architecture.

## Accomplishments

### 1. Token Display Fixed (Again)
- Bar calculation error recurred (showed 16 blocks for 48.9%)
- Updated technical/context-monitoring.md with prominent formula
- Added formula to memory edits with concrete example
- Created prevention measures and self-check process

### 2. Time Estimates Preference Broadened
- Updated from "research and planning" to "all responses"
- Changed "Do not" to "Never" for emphasis
- Added all time units (minutes, hours, days, weeks, months)
- Updated framework-overview.md with prominent note
- Captured rationale (truck driver scattered availability)

### 3. Bootstrap Pattern Documented
- Created technical/project-configuration-nexus.md (10-step guide)
- Created technical/project-creation-perdiem.md (12-step guide)
- Both guides comprehensive with troubleshooting
- Ready for implementation

### 4. Project Separation Strategy Established
- Keep active dev together: Nexus + FnMCP.Nexus + LaundryLog
- Test with PerDiem in separate project
- Gradual migration pattern documented
- Migration checklist created for future apps

### 5. Memory System Enhanced
- Added 3 new memory edits (#6, #7, #8):
  - Bootstrap documentation locations
  - Phase 4 status and next steps
  - Event sourcing locations and timeline
- Created comprehensive updated memory content for overnight process
- Now 8 memory edits total

### 6. Account-Wide Preferences Finalized
- Direct and efficient communication style
- Check context first (tools before asking)
- Fix comprehensively (not just patches)
- Iterative question workflow (overview then one-by-one)
- Universal across all projects

### 7. New Patterns Captured
- Iterative question-answering workflow (MethodologyInsight event)
- Communication preferences (FrameworkInsight event)
- Bootstrap strategy complete (FrameworkInsight event)

## Files Created/Updated

**Documentation:**
- technical/context-monitoring.md (updated with prominent formula)
- technical/project-configuration-nexus.md (new - 10 steps)
- technical/project-creation-perdiem.md (new - 12 steps)
- framework-overview.md (updated with time estimate note)

**Events created this session:** 8 events
- 3 DesignNote (token display, time estimates, memory update)
- 1 TechnicalDecision (project separation strategy)
- 2 FrameworkInsight (token display validated, bootstrap complete, preferences finalized)
- 1 MethodologyInsight (iterative questions)
- 1 SessionState (this event)

## Current State

**Phase 4:** Complete and validated in production
- MCP prompts working
- Continuation context loading
- Token savings confirmed

**Ready for implementation:**
- Bootstrap pattern documented
- Nexus project update guide ready
- PerDiem project creation guide ready

**Preferences solidified:**
- Memory edits updated (8 total)
- Account-wide preferences finalized
- Communication patterns established

## Next Actions

**User actions:**
1. Update account-wide preferences in Claude settings (text provided)
2. Implement bootstrap pattern for Nexus project (follow guide)
3. Create PerDiem separate project (follow guide)
4. Test multi-project pattern
5. Let overnight process update comprehensive memory

**Development priorities:**
- Phase 5: SessionState projection generation
- PerDiem in separate project (test pattern)
- LaundryLog F# implementation (dogfooding)

## Learnings Applied

**Recurrence patterns addressed:**
- Token bar calculation now has prominent formula in memory
- Time estimates preference now comprehensive
- Comprehensive fix pattern established for future

**Communication patterns:**
- Iterative question workflow documented
- Direct and efficient style preferred
- Check context first before asking

## Session Metrics

**Duration:** Extended focused session
**Events created:** 8
**Documentation updated:** 4 files
**New guides created:** 2
**Memory edits added:** 3
**Token usage:** Peaked at 67% (comfortable throughout)

## Quality Notes

Session maintained focus on establishing reusable patterns rather than one-off solutions. All decisions documented for future reference and continuation. Bootstrap strategy provides foundation for scaling to many apps while maintaining efficiency.

**Status:** Complete - ready for implementation phase
**Next session:** Implement bootstrap pattern or continue with Phase 5
