# LaundryLog

Mobile app for truck drivers to track laundry expenses.

## Problem
Truck stop laundry machines don't provide receipts.

## Solution
- GPS location capture
- Manual entry with minimal typing
- Smart defaults (Last/Historical/Community)
- Orange circular quantity controls (108px)
- Silver quarter price adjusters
- Export to CheddarBooks (YAML)

## Status
v7 design complete, ready for Penpot import and F# implementation.

## Key Design Decisions
- Touch targets: 72px minimum, 108px for primary
- Muted orange palette (#FFB366)
- Validation pills show missing requirements
- Session total bar with entry history
